            Since the age of 9, I was drawn to computers and technology in general. As the years passed, I became very
            proficient using computers, particularly my Macintosh Performa 635. Before long, I began to wonder how it
            all works. With that curiosity, I found myself completely disassembling my computer and miraculously putting
            it all back together with no help at all. YouTube University wasn’t around back then. After many more years
            of self-educating myself on the basics of Information Technology, I landed my first IT job as a Technical
            Support Specialist at Philips. With so much exposure to technology and vital company systems, I knew that I
            needed to expand my technical knowledge through formal education. After reading about the Coding Boot Camp,
            I knew this would be the opportunity I’ve been waiting for to help me connect the many “technical dots” that
            I have collected over the years.
